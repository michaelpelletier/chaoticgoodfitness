          <h2>What We Do</h2>

          <p>Chaotic Good Fitness empowers people to improve themselves through movement and habit changes. We rebel against the fitness industry standards in order to help people change the way they think about their own bodies and health and change their bodies for themselves.</p>

          <h2>Our Story</h2>

          <p>Chaotic Good Fitness is the creation of Keira Harbison, a lifelong nerd and educator who discovered weightlifting in college as a way to lose weight. They live in Atlanta, GA with their partner and pupper. When not picking up heavy things and putting them back down, they are playing board games, watching Doctor Who, or reading. They have been an ACSM certified personal trainer since 2018 and are ready to get you where you want to be!</p>
